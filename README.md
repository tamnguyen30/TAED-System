# TAED: Trust-Aware Explainable Defense

Phishing detection system using explainability-based trust metrics for adversarial robustness.

## Paper
Under review (USENIX Security 2026)

## Overview
TAED combines model confidence, explanation fidelity, and explanation stability into a Trust Score metric to detect adversarial phishing attacks that fool traditional ML classifiers.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 18+
- scikit-learn, LIME, transformers
- See `requirements.txt` and `package.json` for full dependencies

## Quick Start
