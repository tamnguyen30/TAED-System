Stephanie:

Go ahead and order the computer battery for Gail Brownfeld.

You  need to get approval from Richard Sanders by e-mail so you will have a 
record he approved it (because he is the cost center owner) before you order 
the flat panel for Michelle Blaine.  Please note, the standard flat panel for 
our department is a 15" panel, definitely not an 18".    When Richard 
approves it you can go ahead and order the flat panel through iBuyit.  

The usual procedure for our department is the cost center owner needs to 
approve any requests for computer equipment before they are purchased.

Thanks.  I hope you are doing well.

I need to order a new computer battery for Gail Brownfeld, as her current one 
has a broken connector.  Also, Michelle Blaine has requested a flat screen 
for her computer.  Can I order these from IBuyIt, or do I need to get 
approval from someone first?  Thanks!

Chris,

Do you know if we were in fact an agent for a third party on the NBPL tport=
 contract T1043F and T1055F?  I looked up these contracts in global and tha=
t's what it's telling me AND there are also TC tickets in Sitara with Ander=
son Exploration as the CP.  For November 2001, we show volumes scheduled in=
 the system, but they were not acutalized.   Soooooooo, I called the pipe t=
o get a statement so that I could.  According to them, these contracts belo=
ng to Numac Energy and we are not the listed agent per their records.  Thes=
e deals were only effective for 2 months, Nov. 2001 and Dec. 2001, so I kno=
w things could have changed during that time period because of the bankrupt=
cy.  We deliver gas from several of our own ENA contracts to these contract=
s, but if we were not their agent, then it makes sense that we have nothing=
 actualized in our system on their contracts.  The other thing that is a li=
ttle confusing is , are Anderson Exploration and Numac Energy one and the s=
ame?  Northern Border did not know.  Let me know what you think........


Thanks,
Rita
